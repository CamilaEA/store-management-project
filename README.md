# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

My project is about my very own Dessert Shop. The Dessert Shop is made up of a super class and two sub classes, a cake and cookie one. I chose to make a Dessert Shop because I love sweets and also like going to Crumbl Cookies. The project uses no-argument constructors, instance variables, parameterized constructors, accessor methods, mutator methods, and toString methods. The instance variables in my Dessert Shop where the name, type, and price. My parameterized constructors sets name to a specific name, type to the specified type, and the price to whatever the user inputs. The no argument constructors set default values to all the classees. Mutator methods are used to set and return certain values. The user input is for the type of dessert and the price of the dessert, more like a budget that the user has. The user will input the type of dessert and price budget they have into the console and wait for the results.
